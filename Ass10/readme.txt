This thing solves given and random linear equations by turning them into minimization problems. Steepest Descent method (the shitty, but pretty) and Conjugate Gradient method (the pain iducing, but ruthlessly efficient).

All visualizations are projections onto the first two dimensions of the problem, since, you know... it's an absolute pain to do 3d and 4d is not even possible.
I tried to project onto 3d, I'm not even sure I understood what that means, much less code it.
